Aerospace (Fuel Efficiency Simulation)
A spacecraft’s fuel efficiency decreases by 0.3% with each kilometer ascended due to gravity and drag.
Generate a 10-element array representing efficiency multipliers and compute the cumulative product to estimate efficiency after each kilometer.

Pharmaceuticals (Drug Absorption)
Simulate hourly absorption rates (as percentages) for a new oral drug over 12 hours.
Use np.cumprod() to estimate total absorption progression over time.

Retail (Customer Retention)
A store retains 95–99% of its customers each month.
Generate 24 months of random retention rates and use cumulative product to estimate the fraction of original customers remaining each month.

Energy (Solar Panel Degradation)
A solar panel loses 0.2–0.4% efficiency per month due to weathering.
Simulate 5 years of performance loss and use np.cumprod() to estimate total efficiency after each month.

Agriculture (Crop Growth Factor)
Each week, a crop grows by a factor between 1.01–1.10 depending on weather.
Use np.cumprod() to simulate plant height progression over 16 weeks starting from 10 cm.

Manufacturing (Assembly Line Yield)
Each production stage has a yield rate between 93–99%.
Generate 15 stages and use np.cumprod() to estimate total yield across the full process.

Transportation (Train Delay Accumulation)
Each station adds a random multiplier between 1.00 and 1.05 to the current delay time due to compounding congestion.
Use np.cumprod() to simulate total delay accumulation over 20 stations starting from a 2-minute base delay.

Healthcare (Viral Load Growth)
A patient’s viral load doubles daily for the first 10 days, but random medication effectiveness reduces the growth factor to between 1.5–2.0.
Simulate the viral load trajectory using np.cumprod().

Climate Science (Temperature Anomaly)
A model predicts that each month’s temperature deviation is 0.1–0.3× the previous month’s anomaly due to climate inertia.
Use np.cumprod() to simulate 24 months of compounding anomaly effects starting from a baseline deviation of +1 °C.

Sports Analytics (Player Performance Index)
An athlete’s performance metric is multiplied each game by a random consistency factor between 0.95 and 1.05.
Simulate 30 games and use np.cumprod() to visualize how small performance fluctuations accumulate over a season.
