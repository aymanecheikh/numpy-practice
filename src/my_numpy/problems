1. Finance (Stock Volatility)

You track the closing prices of a tech stock for 20 days.
Generate an array of simulated daily prices starting from £120 and fluctuating ±2% each day.
Compute the 5-day rolling average prices.

2. Agriculture (Crop Growth Monitoring)

You monitor plant height (in cm) of 6 different crops across 4 weeks.
Simulate the dataset as a 6×4 array with weekly height increments between 1.5 cm and 5 cm.
Find which crop had the largest total height increase over 4 weeks.

3. Energy (Solar Farm Output)

A solar farm records hourly energy output (kWh) for 7 days.
Create a 7×24 array of simulated data where daytime hours (6–18) produce between 100–500 kWh and other hours produce 0–50 kWh.
Find the day with the highest total production.

4. Healthcare (Patient Vitals)

You measure 8 patients’ heart rates every 2 hours over a 24-hour period.
Build a 8×12 array with integer values between 60 and 100.
Compute the mean heart rate for each patient and identify who had the highest average.

5. Transportation (EV Charging Network)

You manage 10 electric vehicle chargers and record their usage (kWh delivered) for 5 days.
Construct a 10×5 array of random integers between 20 and 120.
Find the total energy dispensed per day and per station.

6. Retail (Sales Data)

A store sells 4 products across 6 regions.
Generate a 4×6 array of daily unit sales (between 10 and 200).
Compute the top-selling product and the highest-performing region.

7. Sports Analytics (Player Performance)

Each of 5 basketball players has their points scored across 10 games.
Create a 5×10 array of integers between 5 and 40.
Determine the average points per player and identify any game where a player scored above 35.

8. Aerospace (Fuel Consumption)

You log hourly fuel consumption (kg) for a 4-engine aircraft over a 10-hour flight.
Simulate a 4×10 array of values between 400 and 900.
Find the engine with the most consistent (least variable) consumption.

9. Logistics (Warehouse Inventory)

Track stock levels of 6 items over 8 days.
Start each item at 100 units and subtract random daily shipments between 5 and 15 units.
Compute when each item first dropped below 50 units.

10. Weather Science (Temperature Grid)

A climate scientist collects temperature data over a 5×5 region for 7 days.
Simulate a 7×5×5 array of daily readings between 10 °C and 35 °C.
Find the warmest cell’s average temperature over the week.
